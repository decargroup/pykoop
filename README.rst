``pykoop`` is a Koopman operator identification library written in Python. It
allows the user to specify Koopman lifting functions and regressors in order to
learn a linear model of a given system in the lifted space.

`this talk <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lidd_M7gzvA>`_
or
`this review article <https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12086>`_.


``pykoop`` places heavy emphasis on modular lifting function construction and
``scikit-learn`` compatibility. The library aims to make it easy to
automatically find good lifting functions and regressor hyperparameters by
leveraging ``scikit-learn``'s existing cross-validation infrastructure.
``pykoop`` also gracefully handles control inputs and multi-episode datasets
at every stage of the pipeline.

``pykoop`` also includes several experimental regressors that use linear matrix
inequalities to constraint the asymptotic stability of the Koopman system, or
regularize the regression using its H-infinity norm. Check out
`arXiv:2110.09658 [eess.SY] <https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09658>`_ and
`arXiv:2102.03613 [eess.SY] <https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03613>`_ for details.


Example
=======

Consider Tikhonov-regularized EDMD with polynomial lifting functions applied to
mass-spring-damper data. Using ``pykoop``, this can be implemented as:

.. code-block:: python

    import pykoop
    from sklearn.preprocessing import MaxAbsScaler, StandardScaler

    # Get example mass-spring-damper data
    eg = pykoop.example_data_msd()

    # Create pipeline
    kp = pykoop.KoopmanPipeline(
        lifting_functions=[
            ('ma', pykoop.SkLearnLiftingFn(MaxAbsScaler())),
            ('pl', pykoop.PolynomialLiftingFn(order=2)),
            ('ss', pykoop.SkLearnLiftingFn(StandardScaler())),
        ],
        regressor=pykoop.Edmd(alpha=1),
    )

    # Fit the pipeline
    kp.fit(
        eg['X_train'],
        n_inputs=eg['n_inputs'],
        episode_feature=eg['episode_feature'],
    )

    # Predict using the pipeline
    X_pred = kp.predict_trajectory(eg['x0_valid'], eg['u_valid'])

    # Score using the pipeline
    score = kp.score(eg['X_valid'])

    # Plot results
    kp.plot_predicted_trajectory(eg['X_valid'], plot_input=True)

Library layout
==============

Most of the required classes and functions have been imported into the
``pykoop`` namespace. The most important object is the
:class:`pykoop.KoopmanPipeline`, which requires a list of lifting functions and
a regressor.

Some example lifting functions are

- :class:`pykoop.PolynomialLiftingFn`,
- :class:`pykoop.RbfLiftingFn`,
- :class:`pykoop.DelayLiftingFn`, and
- :class:`pykoop.BilinearInputLiftingFn`.

``scikit-learn`` preprocessors can be wrapped into lifting functions using
:class:`pykoop.SkLearnLiftingFn`. States and inputs can be lifted independently
using :class:`pykoop.SplitPipeline`. This is useful to avoid lifting inputs.

Some basic regressors included are

- :class:`pykoop.Edmd` (includes Tikhonov regularization),
- :class:`pykoop.Dmdc`, and
- :class:`pykoop.Dmd`.

More advanced (and experimental) LMI-based regressors are included in the
``pykoop.lmi_regressors`` namespace. They allow for different kinds of
regularization as well as hard constraints on the Koopman operator.

You can roll your own lifting functions and regressors by inheriting from
:class:`pykoop.KoopmanLiftingFn`, :class:`pykoop.EpisodeIndependentLiftingFn`,
:class:`pykoop.EpisodeDependentLiftingFn`, and
:class:`pykoop.KoopmanRegressor`.

Some sample dynamic models are also included in the ``pykoop.dynamic_models``
namespace.


Installation and testing
========================

``pykoop`` can be installed from PyPI using

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install pykoop

Additional LMI solvers can be installed using

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install mosek
    $ pip install cvxopt
    $ pip install smcp

Mosek is recommended, but is nonfree and requires a license.

The library can be tested using

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    $ pytest

Note that ``pytest`` must be run from the repository's root directory.

To skip unit tests that require a MOSEK license, including all doctests and
examples, run

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pytest ./tests -k "not mosek"

The documentation can be compiled using

.. code-block:: sh

    $ cd doc
    $ make html

If you want a hook to check source code formatting before allowing a commit,
you can use

.. code-block:: sh

   $ cd .git/hooks/
   $ ln -s ../../.githooks/pre-commit.sh .
   $ chmod +x ./pre-commit.sh

You will need ``yapf`` installed for this.
