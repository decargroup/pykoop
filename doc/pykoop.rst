Lifting functions
-----------------

<!-- TODO Explain Preprocessor vs LiftingFn-->

The data matrices provided to :func:`fit` (as well as :func:`transform`
and :func:`inverse_transform`) must obey the following format:

1. If ``episode_feature`` is true, the first feature must indicate
   which episode each timestep belongs to.
2. The last ``n_inputs`` features must be exogenous inputs.
3. The remaining features are considered to be states.

Input example where ``episode_feature=True`` and ``n_inputs=1``:

======= ======= ======= =======
Episode State 0 State 1 Input 0
======= ======= ======= =======
0.0       0.1    -0.1    0.2
0.0       0.2    -0.2    0.3
0.0       0.3    -0.3    0.4
1.0      -0.1     0.1    0.3
1.0      -0.2     0.2    0.4
1.0      -0.3     0.3    0.5
2.0       0.3    -0.1    0.3
2.0       0.2    -0.2    0.4
======= ======= ======= =======

In the above example, there are three distinct episodes with different
numbers of timesteps. The last feature is an input, so the remaining
two features must be states.

If ``n_inputs=0``, the same matrix is interpreted as:

======= ======= ======= =======
Episode State 0 State 1 State 2
======= ======= ======= =======
0.0       0.1    -0.1    0.2
0.0       0.2    -0.2    0.3
0.0       0.3    -0.3    0.4
1.0      -0.1     0.1    0.3
1.0      -0.2     0.2    0.4
1.0      -0.3     0.3    0.5
2.0       0.3    -0.1    0.3
2.0       0.2    -0.2    0.4
======= ======= ======= =======

If ``episode_feature=False`` and the first feature is omitted, the
matrix is interpreted as:

======= ======= =======
State 0 State 1 State 2
======= ======= =======
 0.1    -0.1    0.2
 0.2    -0.2    0.3
 0.3    -0.3    0.4
-0.1     0.1    0.3
-0.2     0.2    0.4
-0.3     0.3    0.5
 0.3    -0.1    0.3
 0.2    -0.2    0.4
======= ======= =======

In the above case, each timestep is assumed to belong to the same
episode.
